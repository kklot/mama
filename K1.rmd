CHANGES:

- change removed questions to `r c(21, 23, 34:35)`
- Group 1 individual in no formal education to primary school

Some issues:

- [x] 8 have repeated IDs with different records --> assume they are different
- [x] 2 with missing all the answer to knowledge --> removed
- [x] no id 73, but two 28, it seems the second one is 73 based on video category

**Statistical analysis**

The questions were scored by allocating +1 point for each correct answer and 0
points if participants answered incorrectly or if they answered: “I don’t know.”
The sum score is thus can be considered as discrete counts with bounded value at
the total number of questions (28 in the case of general question, 21 in the
case of subset of questions relevant to the video, and varied in subgroup
analyse). Thus, we used the Beta-Binomal distribution which can account for
over- and under-dispersion and the fact that the distribution is bounded. The
distribution outperformed the Poisson and Negative Binomal when compared to the
emprical distribution (Figure X - Appendix).

We compared demographic variables distribution between the trial arms with
Chi-square or exact Fisher test as appropriated. We conducted multiple
regression analyses to explore the effect on the overall knowledge scores of the
SAS Intervention group with intention to treat approach. We also conducted the
analyses by four topic sub-groups within the knowledge questionnaire. The topic
sub-groups include breastfeeding, newborn care, pregnancy care, and
breastfeeding and newborn care. The regression models were adjusted for the
demographics variables including age, sex, education level, as well as whether
the mother was enrolled in the MomConnect program. The models were fitted using
Bayesian inference framework using the statistical program R 4.0.2. We reported
the IQR and 95% uncertainty interval of the posterior distribution of the parameter estimates as well as the marignal estimates of the transformed original score to aid interpretion.

There were 11 individuals with missing data in one of the 28 knowledge
questions; in these cases, we applied imputation to randomly sampling the
questions’ response and conducted analyses on the imputed samples to check
sensitivity of the results against those missing values. Finally, we analyzed
the maternal satisfaction data by calculating a mean score for each of the
different subjective user satisfaction questions, to capture maternal
satisfaction related to use of the SAS videos.

```{r meta_group}
read.csv("cate.csv") %>%
    mutate(
        q = paste0("k", q),
        across(pc:bfnc, as_numeric)
    ) %>%
    allot(cate)

# PP or ITT
pp_id <- c(8, 28, 80, 300, 342, 382, 49, 36, 252, 75, 73, 111)

### Demographics and ITT

> Who was assigned to treatment group will be in treatment group, regardless of
> the actual received treatment.

The two groups are comparable as there are no signigicant differences in
demographics. 

```{r demo_itt, results='asis'}
# d_ %<>% mutate(age = factor(age, levels = c('18-24', '25-34', ">35")))
# d_ %<>% mutate(age = as.numeric(age))
d_ %<>% mutate(edu = if_else(edu == "No formal education", "Primary school", edu))
d_ %<>% mutate(age = factor(age, c("18-24", "25-34", ">35")))
d_ %<>% mutate(nat = if_else(nat != "South African", 'Others', nat))
d_ %<>% mutate(across(c(edu, work, partner, momconnect,area), as.factor))

# d_ %>% tabstat(edu, momconnect)

rbind(
    d_ %>% tabstat(age, itt),
    d_ %>% tabstat(edu, itt),
    d_ %>% tabstat(area, itt),
    d_ %>% tabstat(race, itt),
    d_ %>% tabstat(nat, itt),
    d_ %>% tabstat(work, itt),
    d_ %>% tabstat(earn, itt),
    d_ %>% tabstat(partner, itt),
    d_ %>% tabstat(momconnect, itt)
) %>%
kable() %>%
    kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
    add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Video" = 2, " " = 1, " " = 1)) %>%
    pack_rows("Age", 1, 3) %>%
    pack_rows("Education", 4, 5) %>%
    pack_rows("Area", 6, 7) %>%
    pack_rows("Race", 8, 9) %>%
    pack_rows("Nationality", 10, 11) %>%
    pack_rows("Work", 12, 13) %>%
    pack_rows("Earning", 14, 16) %>%
    pack_rows("Partner", 17, 18) %>%
    pack_rows("MomConnect", 19, 20)
```

### Scores distribution

There are 11 individuals with at least one missing questions, sensitivity will
be done using imputation to have the full data for analyses. The imputed data
including age, edu, work, partner, and all 28 knowledge questions.

```{r score_distribution, include=F}
d_ %>%
    mutate(score = rowSums(across(starts_with("k")))) %>%
    count(score) %>%
    kable()
```

Considering the total score distribution by variables one-by-one (univariate)

- Small increase in group with video intervention, both PP and ITT
classification, clearer increase in the ITT. 
- Age-group >35 have high score than others age-groups

```{r score_distribution_plot}
set.seed(2908)
dm <- mice::mice(d_, 10, print = F)
```

## Count outcome {.tabset .tabset.pills}

### Best fit distribution

What distribution fit better to the data, if we assume it to be counts. Figure below shows that both Poisson and Negative Binomal are not a good fit. In this case, the upper bound is known (maximum is 28 correct answers), the `beta-binomial` can be used and showed to be a good fit.

```{r fitdit}
library(gamlss)

dm1 <- complete(dm, 1) %>%
    mutate(score = rowSums(across(starts_with("k"))), iid = id_)

x <- seq(10, 28, .5)
xi <- seq(10, 28, 1)

bb <- gamlss(y ~ 1, data = list(y = as.matrix(cbind(dm1$score, 28 - dm1$score))), family = BB)
bb <- dBB(x, plogis(bb$mu.coefficient), exp(bb$sigma.coefficient), bd = 28)

ps <- gamlss(y ~ 1, data = list(y = dm1$score), family = PO)
ps <- dPO(xi, exp(ps$mu.coefficient))

nb <- gamlss(y ~ 1, data = list(y = dm1$score), family = NBI)
nb <- dNBI(xi, exp(nb$mu.coefficient), exp(nb$sigma.coefficient) + 1e-6)

dm1 %>%
    ggplot(aes(score, fill = "Emprical dat")) +
    geom_density(alpha = .3) +
    coord_cartesian(expand = F) +
    geom_line(aes(score, dens, color = name, linetype = 'name'), data = bind_rows(
        bind_cols(score = x, dens = bb, name = "Beta-binomial"),
        bind_cols(score = xi, dens = ps, name = "Poisson"),
        bind_cols(score = xi, dens = nb, name = "Negative-binomial")
    )) +
    labs(fill ='', y = "Score density (max 28)", title = "Empirical vs theoretical distr.") +
    theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

### Fitted model - beta_binomial

Follow the above results, we fit the model with beta-binomal distribution $score
\sim BB(n, \mu, \sigma)$ where $n=28$ for the total score, and the mean of the
distribution is $n\mu$.

```{r beta_binom, fig.dim = c(9, 4)}
library(brms)

n <- 28
ad <- complete(dm, "all") %>%
    lapply(function(x) {
        mutate(x,
            score = rowSums(across(starts_with("k"))),
            iid = id_, n = n
        )
    })

fit <- brm_multiple(

        score | trials(n) ~ itt + age + edu + work + partner + momconnect + area
    ),
